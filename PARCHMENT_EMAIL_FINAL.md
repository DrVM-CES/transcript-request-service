**Dear Maggie and Kim,**

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to request production SFTP credentials for our new transcript request service integration with the Parchment network.

## **Organization Information**

- **Email**: jamie@coherented.com
- **Phone**: 1-408-687-9718
- **CEEB Code**: N/A - Service Provider

## **Integration Overview**
We've developed a FERPA-compliant transcript request service that generates PESC-standard XML files for automated processing through the Parchment network. Our service handles:

- Student transcript requests with full FERPA compliance
- PESC XML generation (v1.2.0 standards)
- Secure SFTP upload to Parchment processing system
- Complete audit trail for compliance reporting

## **Technical Requirements**
We need production SFTP access credentials for:

**Required Information:**
- SFTP Host/Server address
- Username for our organization
- Password/Authentication method
- Upload directory path (typically `/incoming`)
- Port number (if not standard 22)
- Any specific connection requirements or restrictions

## **Implementation Timeline**
- **Service Status**: Production-ready, awaiting SFTP credentials
- **Desired Go-Live**: Within 5-7 business days
- **Testing Requirements**: We can provide test XML files for validation

## **PESC Compliance**
Our XML generation follows PESC TranscriptRequest v1.2.0 specifications:
- Proper document ID formatting (32 alphanumeric characters)
- Complete student and school information
- Release authorization and consent tracking
- Paired file structure: `[basename]_request.xml` format

## **Next Steps**
Could you please provide:
1. Production SFTP credentials
2. Any specific formatting or naming requirements
3. Testing procedures or validation steps
4. Emergency contact information for technical issues

I've attached detailed technical documentation for your review. Please let me know if you need any additional information or have questions about our implementation.

Thank you for your assistance in helping us serve students more efficiently through the Parchment network.

Best regards,

**Jamie Valenzuela-Mumau**
